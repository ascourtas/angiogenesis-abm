ABM research

- figure out how Notch1-DLL4 and VEGF signalling within/between cells is modelled
	- some main thing is bombarded by this input
- ABM was built using Netlogo -- should I just use that too?
- each cell is composed of a nucleus connected to 8 "membrane nodes"
	- a cell is represented by a 10 x 10 um pixel
 
- links in graph need to be measured, starting out at the average cell surface area ECsa
	- movement of links is important and is tracked

- may want to look up data vis in python -- it kind of sounds like an interactive webpage might be nice?

- see results for ideal alpha and beta values


- each time step is an iteration of a loop
- three main things will happen per iteration:
	- secretion and binding
	- rate adjustment
	- phenotype switch and chemotaxis
- "pixels" will be indices in a 2D array
- array will be a series of structs, which will include both the cell struct and additional protein info?
	- need to have VEGF concentration info in each pixel 


cell struct
 - 1 nuclear node connected to 8 membrance nodes (mNode)
 	- mNode produces sVEGFR1, need a variable for that
 - pointers between all of these
 - size of cell -- should be around 962 x 10^8 cm^2, the average EC surface area (Wait WHAT??)
 - movement?
 	- probably will calculate movability based on other factors, can set movability "number" on a given scale (maybe like 0.0 - 1.0?)

 secretion and binding
 - if pixel.VEGF > 0 && an mNode with VEGFR2 or an mNode with membrane bound VEGFR1 or sVEGFR1, then binding will occur until limiting factor
 	- note: when VEGF binds to VEGFR2, we get phosphorylated VEGFR2 (pR2)
 		- this increases amount of DLL4 production in that given cell (see equation 1)
 		- note: do I need to have a set value for k? is that a problem? can always make one up if need be for now, just to get demo going
 			- can probably lookup degradation rate of DLL4
 	- when sVEGFR1 or mVEGFR2 are bound to ligands, nothing else happens


 phenotype switch and chemotaxis
 - if cell.pr2 > ÃŸ, phenotype = tip cell, otherwise, stays quiescent
 - choose mNode with highest pR2, move towards neighbor pixel with highest VEGEF
 -  


 Questions:
 - should I have a visualization? what should it be? each pixel is outputted, in a grid?
 	- if we do this, should I just make an interactive webpage type thing?
 - nixed NetLogo
 - make up value for k?
 - any news on data sets or anything like that?
 thing, but mae
 Notes:
 - keep the 10 um distances
 -early April laf
 - start with ditsance thing, but should be able to change it later
